### **Color Scheme:**

​
As the company logo is red, I chose to use a red #9d080b from the logo as the main colour for creating backgrounds, hover effects and hr elements etc and a white backround for the entire site to help the red jump of the page.

I used #f8f8f8 for the background of the contact form as this worked well with the red and white colour scheme already in place, and helped to break this page up slightly. It also helped it to stand out from the other elements, as the contact form is the most important part of the page.
​

## **Typography**

​
I decided to import the ASAP font from Google Fonts, which can be found at the top of styles.css and I chose this because I felt it worked well with the company image, it's not a font which is widely used and it styled very nicely onto all pages and elements where it was used.
​

​

## **Current Features Common to all pages**

​

#### _Navigation Bar:_

This is an example of the features section, your going to talk about each section of the page and what it offers for the navbar for example
​

- The user is given links to each section of the page
- Each option is presented in a way that is always obvious and reable
- on smaller screens a hamburger menu is provided to ensure mobile users have an optimal experience
  ​

#### \*features

​

- This is where you will place all of your features think about each section of the page include a screenshot and a few bullet points on how it's presented and why
  ​

## **Future-Enhancements**

​

## **Testing Phase**

- Responsiveness - How do you test this, dev tools? checking on multiple devices?
  ​
- Functionality - Each feature needs to be tested before something is complete, talk about the process, click each link check each image, does form validation work, if your using javascript or anything else, does it always behave as the user expects
  ​

  - CSS warnings:

  Three warnings were as per the image below. The first is due to the import of Google Fonts. The last two were due to a background and border color being the same, however this was needed to apply consistency to the hover feature applied to the button.
