​

## **Typography**

​
Here is a chance to discuss the fonts used and again why.
​

  ​

## **Current Features Common to all pages**

​

#### _Navigation Bar:_

This is an example of the features section, your going to talk about each section of the page and what it offers for the navbar for example
​

- The user is given links to each section of the page
- Each option is presented in a way that is always obvious and reable
- on smaller screens a hamburger menu is provided to ensure mobile users have an optimal experience
  ​

#### \*features

​

- This is where you will place all of your features think about each section of the page include a screenshot and a few bullet points on how it's presented and why
  ​

## **Future-Enhancements**

​

## **Testing Phase**

- Responsiveness - How do you test this, dev tools? checking on multiple devices?
  ​
- Functionality - Each feature needs to be tested before something is complete, talk about the process, click each link check each image, does form validation work, if your using javascript or anything else, does it always behave as the user expects
  ​
- Validators - Here include images from w3c html validator and css jigsaw (jshint for js and pep8 for python) and the results that came from it
